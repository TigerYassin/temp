                                    You must select one of these options. If you simply ignore the alarm, or clear it away temporarily, it will go off again; it interprets that as a snooze! If this seems like a hassle, well, that's the point of an alarm.

                                                <li>Again, my current legal situation (noted above) currently restricts me from having unlimited access to copyrighted material. The USA has a fair share of free audio preview clips, yet some parts of the world do not. If you are unsatsified with the selection in your country, email me and I will send you a refund for the inconvenience.</li>

                                                    <li>While the device is awake: Pull down on the notification and select Snooze.</li>

                                                <li>Playlists are collections of songs. In this app, setting a Playlist as your alarm means that a random song from the Playlist will wake you up every morning.</li>

                                                <li>Until Spotify approves an official partnership with me, it is illegal for me to directly stream any copyrighted music from the Spotify app. I would get sued. This is why I can only provide 30 second preview clips, and it is also why you have to create playlists within the app. While this may sound awful, the app continues to improve in great strides. The first version of the app, in January 2019, wouldn’t let you lock your screen or even leave the app at night! The second version didn’t have ANY playlist support, and had tons of bugs. The app is continuing to improve every day and it will eventually offer all of Spotify’s content through the app. Email me for any updates on this progess!</li>
