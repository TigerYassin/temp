    <div id="privacy_content"><h2>Spotify Alarm Clock Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p> I, Will Said created the Spotify Alarm Clock app. This SERVICE is provided by
                        Will Said  and is intended for use as is.
                      </p> <p>This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure
                        of Personal Information and Data for anyone who decides to use my Service.
                      </p> <p>If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in
                        relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving
                        the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described
                        in this Privacy Policy.
                      </p> <p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p> <p>
                          All data for my app is stored locally on your Device. I therefore cannot see any of your data unless I have physical access to your device.
                          I store the Alarm data on your app so that you do not have to input new alarms each time you open the app.
                          My app includes an API to Spotify, and it is likely they store information about you as well, although I did not have any role in the
                          creation of the Spotify app and therefore am not sure. Please refer to their Privacy Policy.
                    </p>  <div>
                      </p> <p><strong>Childrenâ€™s Privacy</strong></p> <p>These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect
                        any information from children under 13. In the case I discover that a child
                        under 13 has provided me with personal information, I will immediately delete their data from
                        the servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal
                        information, please contact me. My contact information can be found at the home of my website, willsaid.com.
