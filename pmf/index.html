                          from using your product is that they haven't heard of your product.

                            Marc Andreessen's essay
                            <u><a href="https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_startups_part4.html">The Only Thing That Matters</a></u>
                            listed the 3 most common reasons put forth for a startup's success (team, market, product) and claimed
                            that the market is the only factor that matters [1] for a product's success.
                        </p><p>
                            Marc discusses "product/market fit" (coined by Andy Rachleff) as being crucial to success,
                            and explains the phenomenon as when the market "pulls" a product out of a team.
                        </p><p>
                            That's vague, so every startup founder seems to have his or her
                            own concrete definition of product/market fit.
                            A useful and concrete definition is needed, for two reasons.
                            First, to know if you are there, although
                            if you have to ask that question, the answer is probably no.
                            The second reason is to know how to get there,
                            which you can do by walking backward from that known destination
                            to where you stand now.
                        </p><p>
                            One of the concrete ways product/market fit is explained is when
                            a lot of your users (40% is frequently cited)
                            would be pissed off if you shelved the product.
                        </p><p>
                            However, i have made several apps that reached this point
                            yet certainly hadn't reached product/market fit. In every case,
                            the product was perfect for the large majority of active users,
                            but no one outside that group wanted to use the app,
                            even if they were the target audience.
                            For example, MealMe started off as the social media for food.
                            Every active user loved the app and would've been pissed if
                            we shelved the product, but they couldn't convince their foodie friends
                            to download it. We were "overfitting" users on the product.
                        </p><p>
                            I've personally seen 6 apps rank in the charts for Top 100 Paid,
                            and experienced product/market fit on 3 of those.
                            So, here is my concrete definition of what product/market fit really is:
                        </p><p>
                            <u><b>
                            The only thing preventing most people in your target market
                            from using your product is that they haven't heard of your product.
                            </b></u>
                        </p><p>
                            When you reach this point, you have reached product/market fit,
                            and the main focus should be making sure everyone in that market hears
                            about the product.
                        </p><p>
                            Note that achieving product/market fit doesn't necessarily
                            mean the product will create much captured value (<u><a href="http://paulgraham.com/wealth.html">wealth</a></u>).
                            Value is dependent on the size of the market.
                            For example, my app Mideo reached product/market fit,
                            but the target market is quite small: iPhone and Android users
                            who don't want their music to pause when they record a video.
                            It still has been one of the top paid apps on both iOS and Android for months,
                            with hundreds of thousands of users on both operating systems,
                            but the market size pales in comparison to that of, say, people who
                            want to travel farther than a walking distance (Ford's Model T).
                        </p><p>
                            I find this definition useful for iterating towards product/market fit.
                            A product must have something immediately compelling enough
                            for someone in my target audience to try my product
                            <i>and</i> like it enough to return. These are both
                            quantifiable and concrete as the conversion rate and cohort retention. [2]
                        </p><p>
                            For example, MealMe's (current) target market consists of people
                            who want to order food and save money or time.
                            Even if MealMe is better in every way than any other food delivery app,
                            that isn't necessarily
                            enough to immediately convince most food delivery
                            users to swap out their current product for MealMe.
                        </p><p>
                            The product has to be so much better than any existing solution
                            that it's simply instinctual for the median food delivery
                            user to use MealMe, assuming they are aware of it.
                        </p><p>
                            Then, i will expand the target market.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Notes</h4>

                        <p>
                            [1]:
                            The only thing i would add: if a team is truly great,
                            they will keep iterating or pivoting
                            the product or market until they reach product/market fit.
                            Success is inevitable for a determined founder.
                            For this reason, Determination is the <b>only</b> thing that matters
                            for a <i>team</i>, although the market is the <b>only</b> thing
                            that matters for a <i>product</i>.
                        </p><p>
                            [2]:
                            This could be seen as trying to create a science out of what was previously
                            seen as an art. It's possible that
                            the art would be left to finding the right combination
                            of product and market. However, that search might not
                            be an art at all. What if it is chance? If so, then
                            Determination really is the only thing that matters -
                            determined founders get more lottery tickets every day they work.
